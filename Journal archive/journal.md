![oled](https://github.com/TreakeeOG/pi.keeb/blob/main/assets/thumbnail.png?raw=true)

Okay, this is freaking amazing! I Have officially wrapped up making pi.keeb, GitHub is totally configured, all files uploaded, designs finalized and prayers called 🙏 Now I'll just submit the Project and hope for the best here is the day 8 story: last night i stayed up wayy past my bedtime and tried to make the QMK software for the keyboard, but i ultimately failed, it was some errors about packages and QMK not able to find those, i don't even wanna talk about it. So I switched to KMK which was comparatively easir to setup and write in, as based in python and i have the basics rooted in python, it was not a huge task for me, today evening i officially finished writing the code for the board and added them to GitHub now we wait. thanks to all the people that helped me out during the process and my parent for supporting my crazy shenanigans ! till the next one, see ya 👋

## Sat, Feb 7: DAY 7 

Big Day today! submitted my design for fusering event, finalized case design for hack pad. So while surfing all the YSWS programs that Hack Club has active i stumbled across the Fusering event, this was perfect to get a hands on experience with fusion 360 as i had absolutely no ideas about the software, a good 3 hours spent, learnt a lot about extruding, merging and all that cad stuff, This helped me to make the hack pad case for my design and i love it ! you can check my GitHub there i have the BTS images uploaded for the hack pad n all ! I Hope I'll complete the Hack pad by this weekend and also will probably submit it for review ! And if the my luck hasn't run out, i might get the things to build it after my exams!

## Thu, Feb 5: DAY 6

Soo I'm very excited to update that the pcb is officially done !, now only remains the shell, plate, and the firmware this part shouldn't take that long! today i rewired the pcb minimum of 5 times in order to get those errors checked, and yeah saw the blue print guide was updated! cool, so also worked on my second project, pi.splitz, it's HHKB format split keyboard with my original design, i got the layout sorted and few sketch doen, i might submit this project and move onto pi.splitz, it's so exciting to learn all this, last week i had no ideas about what a ground fill was, lol. so I'll soon update and prettify (is this word even real?) the GitHub repo (hopefully), and yeah very soon your eyes will be blessed by witnessing the pi,keeb so yeah stay tuned PS: I've officially gave up on adding images </3, and the inconsistent journalling is because my exams are coming up and i need to stop making this or I'll probably fail my graduation, soo yeah see ya

## Wed, Feb 4: DAY 5 

okay a lot of things ! today i learned a lot about pcb wiring and vias, also about fillin the whole area with gnd fill. I tried to complete the Whole PCB today but i keep running into Wiring issues, and footprint issues, sorting them took like a solid hour at the end of the day i ended up with a cool looking pcb that unfortunately does not pass the DRC test in KiCAD, so it's better I'll rewire them tomorrow, and this time maybe not mess it up! i also discovered the expert mode last night, it's amazing so many more guided project, actually got inspired for my next submission the pi.splitz a split keyboard inspired by the guide with my own design touch, i also sketched up some tough drawings (will definitely add them in next entry). with that the day 5 concludes (it'll show up as 4th march but i wrote this up at like 2 am in the night 3rd feb so yeah) images (hopefully, can't figure out for the life of me):

## Mon, Feb 2: DAY 4
### Day 4:

Alright This is my first post after the introductory post! This is officially day 4 For The Blueprint program, sadly no progress today but i'll quickly sum up day 1 through Day 3

### Day 1:

I just click random buttons on the KiCAD app, scroll through the Blueprint Docs, try to figure what i need to learn in order to make my hackpad, eventually after 2 hours have slipped away i figured that i need to be comfotable in KiCAD and Fusion to successfullt make a keeb that will get approved and i can hopefully make it irl, so i sketch some ideas, designs layout Ps: Spoiler alert i did not stick to initial sketch due to bumping into restrains that i bump into in future (short on pins on the board :( )

### Day 2:

Last night i learned About Key matrix in keyboards, it is a arrangement of keys in rows and colums similar to matrix that significantly reduces the no. of pins on the microcontroller used, i completed the schematics and went to sleep!

![schematic](https://github.com/TreakeeOG/pi.keeb/blob/main/Journal%20archive/assets/schem.png?raw=true)

### Day 3:

today is the PIN DREAD day, i run into pin shortage on the board while wiring and linking the knobs and oled, so i cut down from original 11 key + knob + oled to a 5 key + knob + oled layout, but to my sorrow i did not manage to put them under the pincount of the Seed XIOA 2040, so i finally settel on 6 keys + 1 knob + oled design, a square compact and minimal (hopefully), design with the schematic wired and pcb formatted!
